#Project 4

The hardest part of the assignment for us was realizing the steps of logging in and then 
wrapping our dependencies.  We are pretty new to Python so this has been a challenge.  We 
built our application to use beautiful soup.  Because the Khoury machines do not have this
we had to figure out a way to wrap our dependencies.
